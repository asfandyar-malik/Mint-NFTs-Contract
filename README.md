# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This is the contract created for the NFT Marketplace code.  

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.# Mint-NFTs-Contract
